# Vision AI Developer Kit

## Overview

This repo contains the components needed to use the Vision AI Developer Kit (VAI DevKit) to develop Neural Network models which can be deployed to the Vision AI DevKit hardware. Manufactured through a partnership between [Altek](http://www.altek.com.tw/en-global/news/detail/127) and [eInfochips](https://www.einfochips.com/partnerships-and-alliances/digital-partnerships/microsoft/), the Vision AI DevKit uses the [Qualcomm QCS603](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/vision-intelligence-300-platform) chipset, a member of the [Qualcomm Vision Intelligence Platform](https://developer.qualcomm.com/hardware/vertical-platforms/vision-intelligence-platform).
